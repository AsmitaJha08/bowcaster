I originally created the MIPS payload Python modules prior to the existence of
Bowcaster.  Since I had already generated the Python code, I didn't do a great
job in all cases of keeping up with the original assembly files.  I've gathered
them together as well as I could.  These should more or less represent the MIPS
payloads that are in Bowcaster, but they aren't guaranteed to assemble to the
exact same binary code that is found in the payload modules.
